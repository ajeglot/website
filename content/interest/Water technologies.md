## Water cycle

Water is an essential ressource for life on our planet. It flows contrinuously around the water cycle, changing states continuously.
From the surface water that we can all see in streams, lakes and seas, water evaporates to become clouds that will eventually distributed it back on land.
Most of it will end up in higher grounds such as mountains and plateaus and flow down in watersheds or water valley. The streams paths have shaped
the surface of earth since its beginning. It is also true for underground lakes where water percolates before coming back to the surface closer to the sea level
in wetlands, swamps and streams. Water is a great body for mixing in this different states, multiple chemicals in molecules are contained in water bodies.
Making it a great source of necessary nutrient for life.

## Drinking Water

**Sources**

Pure water perfectly suitable for drinking are actually coming out of most mountain springs. Rarely this source can be precontaminated by excess of chemicals or matter (Iron and mud for example).
The water from this streams usually gets contaminated along its way to the sea but in general the most suitable bodies for drinking water are surface water and underground water.
For underground water the first step is its detection. Nowadays, elaborated drone map the ground sending and receiveing electromagnetic waves. Once the underground lake is identified, then a extraction 
site is build to pump the water from the ground and direct it to the nearest drinking water treatment plant. Similarly, the surface water is reaching the 
treatment plant.

**Treatment**

Drinking water treatment is most often composed of a biological treatment in sand filters aiming at filtrating coarse particules and 
shifting the nitrogen atoms from liquid to gas phase. Several steps of filtration can follow depending on the source and the regulations:
micro-filtration, nano-filtration and reverse osmosis. A disinfection stage is also most often conducted using high UV intensity 
or chlorine. 

**Distribution**

The indispensable role of safe drinking water in our daily life has create the need to have very elaborated network of distribution. Once treated the water is 
dispatched towards storage units, such as water towers, closer to final distribution. Then the water is distributed in the city using the pressure created by the location and 
the height of the water towers coupled with pumping station. The water is ussually supplied at a pressure between 1-4 bars in Europe and the USA. 

Some or part of the steps involved in water supply are either insured by a governmental institutions, represented by a local office or contracted companies expert in water technologies. 


**Consumption**

## Wastewater distribution

Wastewater is treated in different ways depending on its source. But in most cases the water is transported to treatment plants through a 
sewage network. Similarly to the drinking water distribution, wastewater is dispatched to the treatment plants through pressurized pipes. 
However, because of the oxygen conditions in the sewage network some harmful compounds are created such as sulfuric acid that deteriorate the
inner layer of the piping, eventually leading to cracks and leakages in the network. Therefore, a lot of ressources are used to research ways to 
minimize this effect: different pipping material, changing oxygen conditions, addition of iron coumpounds to name a few.
